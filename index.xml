&lt;p&gt;I recently expanded my collection of Mac OS X devices to include a new desktop
system and immediately became irritated by having to re-install and
re-configure all of my software. I realise this is a common problem and decided
to investigate further. I came across an
&lt;a href=&#34;http://sysadvent.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/day-14-manage-your-mac-without-going.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
which basically described a near perfect solution to this problem. This blog
post is more of a personal reminder of how to backup my Mac OS X devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuration of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lra/mackup&#34;&gt;Mackup&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly simple
(which is one of the main reasons I like it) as all you need to do is provide a
valid configuration file and then execute one simple command. Your
configuration file can be empty if you wish to use the ~/Dropbox/Mackup
directory for you backups. If, like me, you prefer to avoid putting all your
data on a remote server that you don&amp;rsquo;t own then you can tweak the default
configuration file ~/.mackup.cfg to use a local folder. My particular
~/.mackup.cfg file is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[storage]
engine = file_system
path = Documents/Computing
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;execution&#34;&gt;Execution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your configuration in place the following two commands are fairly
self explanatory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mackup backup
$ mackup restore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
